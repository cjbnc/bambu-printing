# Micro-Swiss Flowtech Hotend

I wanted to upgrade my OEM 0.4 hotend to something hardened. At the
time, BamuLabs was short on stock just afte Christmas, so I looked into
the kits available from
[Micro-Swiss](https://store.micro-swiss.com/collections/micro-swiss-flowtech/products/flowtech-hotend-for-bambu-lab-x1-and-p1-printers) instead.

The advantage of being able to change the nozzle size without
dismantling the entire hotend was a big appeal for me. I installed the
hotend kit with the hardened, high-flow 0.4 nozzle on 2025-01-24 and
I've been printing with it ever since. I also picked up the brass 0.2
nozzle and a hardened 0.6 nozzle to try with it.

At three weeks of use, I can say I'm generally happy with my purchase.
I've used the 0.4 with glow and wood filaments with no problems, and
regular filaments as well are also no problem. I've swapped and tried
the 0.2 nozzle and the fine details are quite amazing. I haven't tried
the 0.6 yet. I was going to use it with Wood, but so far the Bamabu Wood
that I have is doing fine in the 0.4.

Changing the nozzle is a breeze.
- let it cool to room temperature (ish)
- remove the silicone sock
- unscrew the old nozzle
- screw in the new nozzle
- replace the sock
- tell the printer it has a different nozzle
and continue with printing. That's it, usually takes only a minute or so.

I have noticed a slight tendency to heat creep. It clogged and stopped
completely when I was ironing a large area, but that could be my
settings as much as anything. I've also had a couple times where the
printer retracted the filament OK, but I noticed the cut end was a
little bit wide when trying to remove it from my AMS. No big deal to
trim the end and keep going.
