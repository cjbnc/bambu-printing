# Wood PLA notes

I have two spools of Bambu Wood PLA 
- Rosewood
- White Oak

The Rosewood seems to work fine. Printed a few models with 0.4 nozzle
and had no issues.

The White Oak has been mostly problems. I've had a couple tube clogs on
retraction and one nozzle clog with the 0.4. I dried the spool for 6
hours at 45C and tried again with a 0.6 nozzle. Still getting retraction
clogs (2 out of 6 color changes). The print looks ok but there are
random bits of white oak scattered on it. At this point I'm drying it
again, 50C for 10 hours. Hopefully that helps.

Suggested for Bambu:

- Nozzle Temp: 225 First, 220 Others
- Bed Temp (Textured PEI): 70 First, 65 Others
- Max Volumetric Speed: 20
- No cooling for first 3 layers
